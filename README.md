# Analog Circuit Simulations using Multisim

This repository contains simulation files for various **analog electronics circuits** designed and tested using **NI Multisim**. These simulations are useful for understanding the behavior of fundamental analog components and are often part of basic electronics and ECE curricula.

##  List of Simulated Circuits

-  **BJT Amplifier**
-  **Clampers Circuit**
-  **FET (Field Effect Transistor)**
-  **Full Wave Rectifier**
-  **Half Wave Rectifier**
-  **Positive and Negative Clipper**
-  **RC Coupled Amplifier**
-  **Symmetric and Asymmetric Clipper**

Each circuit is saved as a Multisim 14 design file (`.ms14`) and can be opened and simulated using NI Multisim.
